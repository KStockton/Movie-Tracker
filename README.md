## Movie-Tracker Featuring the MovieDB API

### Goals and Objectives:
The goal of this project was to create an application where a user could sign in and out while saving their favorite movies. This project was created using React.js, React Router and Redux.


## Setup

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/KStockton/Movie-Tracker] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Request an API key from Movie DB [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup)

Search for ```process.env.REACT_API_MOVIEDB``` and replace with your API key.

You will also need to run the back end server, found at:

```clone the backend repo https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker```

start backend first(local 3000) before starting frontend ui(local 3001)

Once you have cloned the repo, install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
Open http://localhost:3000/
